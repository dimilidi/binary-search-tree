# Binary Search Tree Program

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The program allows users to interactively insert, delete, and find elements in the binary search tree.

## Features

- Insert elements into the binary search tree
- Delete elements from the binary search tree
- Find the path to a specific element in the binary search tree
- Interactive command-line interface for user interaction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-search-tree.git

2. Navigate to project directory

    ```
    cd binary-search-tree
    ```
3. Compile the java files

    ```
    javac *.java
    ```
4. Run the Main program
    ```
    java Main 
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the binary search tree. You can insert, delete, or find elements in the tree.

6. To exit the program, type exit at any time.

### Example
Here's an example of how to interact with the program:
    
    ----------------------
    Binary Search Tree:
    ----------------------
    80
    ┌── 70
    │      60
    50
    │      40
    └── 30
    20
    
    What do you want to do?
    Type 'insert' followed by the value to insert (e.g., 'insert 40')
    Type 'delete' followed by the value to delete (e.g., 'delete 40')
    Type 'find' followed by the value to find (e.g., 'find 40')
    Type 'exit' to quit.
